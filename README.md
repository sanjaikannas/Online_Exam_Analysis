# Online_Exam_Analysis

In this we project analysed Kalvee Business case study for analysis of Online exam data. 
We have followed the six phases of data analysis:
<li>Ask: The data analyst is given a problem/business task. 
<li>Prepare: This step includes collecting data and storing it for further analysis
<li>Process: After the data is collected from multiple sources, it is time to clean the data
<li>Analyse: The cleaned data is used for analyzing and identifying trends.
<li>Share: The data now transformed has to be made into a visual(chart, graph).
<li>Act: After a presentation is given based on your findings, the stakeholders discuss whether to move forward or not.
